# MAUI Test MVVM

In this sample we are simulating a simple contacts list (But, With random names) So there's no sorting.
In this sample we are demonstrating Syncfusion ListView, SfAvatarView and Incremental Loading list. 
Also we are using using Fody for easier bindings, refer to out [Fody Sample](https://github.com/NGameTutorials/01_Fody) for better understanding.
